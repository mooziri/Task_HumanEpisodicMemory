# Task_HumanEpisodicMemory

Description: 
This task is written for visual episodic memory experiments in humans, using PsychToolbox. Task structure is shown in the accompanying figure (Paradigm). Briefly, the task is divided into two sections, the Encoding and the Retrieval. For the encoding section, in every trial after presentation of a fixation cue for 2 sec, the visual stimulus appears for 1 sec. Next, a random question appears, which is designed to make the subject attend to the stimuli. For the Retrieval section, in every trial after presentation of a fixation cue for 2 sec, the visual stimulus appears for 1 sec. Next, the subject should select whether the image was new or old to himself. A third category of visual stimuli also exists, similar stimuli, which are similar but not identical to the old stimuli. Based on your own interest, they could be considered either as new or old stimuli. To fit the parameters for your own experiment, apply changes to exp_parameters function.
